### 🛡️ Security Perspective
While developing this project, in addition to object-oriented programming principles:
- **Exception Handling:** Special exception classes were used to prevent unexpected inputs from crashing the system.
- **Data Security:** Data integrity was taken into account during file reading/writing operations.
